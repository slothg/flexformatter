This code is an Eclipse plug-in for formatting ActionScript and mxml source code.  It is intended as an add-on to FlexBuilder, although it does not require a FlexBuilder install (that is, it will run on top of plain Eclipse 3.3+).

The project home is on source forge.  I just use googlecode to host the update site for technical reasons.
